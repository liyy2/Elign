# QM9 post-training config that targets the dominant stability gap:
# many generations are RDKit-valid but QM9-unstable due to ±1 valence errors
# (e.g., C=3 or C=5, N=2 or N=4). This adds an explicit over-bond penalty on
# top of the existing under-bond penalty.

reward:
  # Penalize each missing bond order (e.g., C with 3 instead of 4 contributes 1).
  valence_underbond_weight: 1.5
  # Penalize each excess bond order (e.g., C with 5 instead of 4 contributes 1).
  valence_overbond_weight: 1.0
