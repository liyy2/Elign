# v8: "DFT-push" variant.
#
# Goal: improve downstream DFT energy/force by making the UMA objectives better
# aligned with our downstream metrics:
# - use RMS aggregation (closer to the oracle metric we report)
# - keep the per-atom force clip moderate (avoid outliers dominating PPO)
# - increase energy advantage weight now that v6 fixes the per-atom energy transform

reward:
  force_aggregation: rms
  force_clip_threshold: 3.0
  energy_adv_weight: 0.1
