# Force-only stability run.
#
# Drops the energy channel (often noisy / out-of-distribution) and relies on:
# - UMA force magnitude (local relaxation)
# - explicit QM9 valence stability bonus
# - explicit missing-valence (under-bond) penalty
# while keeping RDKit validity×uniqueness high via filtering/invalid penalties.

reward:
  use_energy: false
  energy_adv_weight: 0.0
  # Push harder on stability/valence than the mixed energy+force config.
